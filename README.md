# safetyNet
Emergency Contact Android App built with Ionic

## What does it do?

Broadcasts a users location to selected contacts when a timer expires

## Why would I want to do that?

Let's say you get out of work late at night and the route to your car / bus / train is dark, scary, and filled with things that go bump in the night.

Just think, 'How long will it take me to get there, 5 minutes?'

Set a timer for 5 minutes, if a ghoul attacks on your way there you won't cancel the timer and you friends will be alerted with a custom message and your location.

Help is on the way!!!

## How does it work?

1. Create a 'safetyNet' of contacts you wish to alert, you can create as many as you want and name them whatever is easiest for you to remember.
2. Create a custom message to send to your contacts. Again, you can create as many as you want and name them whatever is easiest for you to remember.
3. Set a timer selecting the safetyNet and custom message you wish to use.
4. Cancel the timer when you reach your destination safely.

## How much does it cost?

The only possible costs would be incurred by your cell phone provider at text message rates. The app itself will be free, because the world could use a little less fear.
